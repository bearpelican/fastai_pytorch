# How to contribute to fastai

First, thanks a lot for wanting to help!

## Did you find a bug?

* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/fastai/fastai_v1/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/fastai/fastai_v1/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
* Be sure to add the complete error messages.

#### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/fastai/fastai_v1).
* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* Before submitting, please read the [doc on code style](https://github.com/fastai/fastai_v1/blob/master/docs/style.md) and [the one on abbreviations](https://github.com/fastai/fastai_v1/blob/master/docs/abbr.md) and clean-up your code accordingly.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* You can suggest your change on the [fastai forum](http://forums.fast.ai/) to see if others are interested or want to help.
* PRs are welcome with a complete description of the new feature and an example of how it's use. Be sure to document your code and read the [doc on code style](https://github.com/fastai/fastai_v1/blob/master/docs/style.md) and [the one on abbreviations](https://github.com/fastai/fastai_v1/blob/master/docs/abbr.md).

## Do you have questions about the source code?

* Please ask it on the [fastai forum](http://forums.fast.ai/) (after searching someone didn't ask the same one before with a quick search).

## Do you want to contribute to the documentation?

* Please read [Contributing to the documentation]() *link to be added*

## How to contribute to jupyter notebooks

* Please read the following sections if you're contributing to `*.ipynb` notebooks.

### Validate any notebooks you're contributing to

* When you are done working on a notebook improvement, if you were using a text editor to make  changed, please, make sure to validate that notebook's format, by simply loading it in the jupyter notebook.

Alternatively, you could use a CLI JSON validation tool, e.g. [jsonlint](https://jsonlint.com/):

    jsonlint-php example.ipynb

but it's second best, since you may have a valid JSON, but invalid notebook format, as the latter has extra requirements on which fields are valid and which are not.

### Autogenerate nb_*.py files

* When you finish working on a notebook, make sure to run:

    tools/build

If you're on windows and don't have bashÂ¸ please run this instead:

    python tools\build

This will convert any modified `dev_nb/*.ipynb` to `nb_*.py`. Do not modify any of the `nb_*.py` manually, since your changes will be overwritten by the autogenerator.


### Git: a mandatory notebook strip out

Currently we only store `source` code cells under git (and a few extra fields for documentation notebooks). If you would like to commit or submit a PR, you need to confirm to that standard.

This is done automatically during `diff`/`commit` git operations, but you need to configure your local repository once to activate that instrumentation.

Therefore, your developing process will always start with:

    git clone https://github.com/fastai/fastai_v1
    cd fastai_v1
    tools/trust-origin-git-config

The last command tells git to invoke configuration stored in `fastai_v1/.gitconfig`, so your `git diff` and `git commit` invocations for this particular repository will now go via `tools/fastai-nbstripout` which will do all the work for you.

Note: windows users, not using bash emulation, will need to invoke the command as:

    python tools\trust-origin-git-config

If you skip this configuration your commit/PR involving notebooks will not be accepted, since it'll carry in it many JSON bits which we don't want in the git repository. Those unwanted bits create collisions and lead to unnecessarily complicated and time wasting merge activities. So please do not skip this step.

Note: we can't make this happen automatically, since git will ignore a repository-stored `.gitconfig` for security reasons, unless a user will tell git to use it (and thus trust it).

If you'd like to check whether you already trusted git with using `fastai_v1/.gitconfig` please look inside `fastai_v1/.git/config`, which should have this entry:

    [include]
            path = ../.gitconfig

or alternatively run:

    tools/trust-origin-git-config -t
